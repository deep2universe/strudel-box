## Full Description

### What is Strudel Box?

Strudel Box transforms VS Code into a live coding music studio. Built on [Strudel](https://strudel.cc), the popular JavaScript-based live coding language, this extension lets you create algorithmic music patterns, experiment with sounds, and even perform live — all without leaving your editor.

Whether you're a musician exploring code, a developer curious about generative music, or a live performer looking for a portable setup, Strudel Box has you covered.

### Works in VS Code — Built for Kiro

Strudel Box is fully compatible with VS Code and works out of the box. However, it was developed for and with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), AWS's agentic IDE. When used with Kiro, you unlock powerful AI-assisted features:

🤖 **Spec-Driven Development** — Use Kiro's structured specs to design and iterate on complex musical patterns with AI guidance

🎸 **Vibe Coding** — Let AI help you explore new sounds, suggest pattern variations, and remix your beats in real-time

📋 **Kiro Template** — Get started instantly with our [Strudel Box Template](https://github.com/deep2universe/strudel-box-template) — pre-configured steering rules, example patterns, and AI prompts for music creation

### Why Strudel Box?

🎹 **Zero Setup** — No external software, no complex configuration. Install and start making music in seconds.

⚡ **Real-Time Feedback** — Hear your patterns instantly with low-latency audio playback. Perfect for live coding performances.

🎨 **Stunning Themes** — Three handcrafted visual themes (Cyberpunk, Halloween, 8-Bit) with animated particle backgrounds that react to your music.

📁 **Native File Support** — Work with `.strudel` files like any other code. Syntax highlighting, custom icons, and a dedicated file explorer included.

🎛️ **Built-in Sample Library** — Access legendary drum machines (TR-808, TR-909, TR-707), piano samples, and the classic Dirt-Samples collection out of the box.

🎯 **Keyboard-First Workflow** — Evaluate patterns with `Ctrl+Enter`, stop with `Ctrl+.`. Designed for flow state.

### Perfect For

- **Musicians** who want to explore algorithmic composition
- **Developers** curious about creative coding and generative art
- **Live Performers** who need a reliable, portable live coding environment
- **Educators** teaching music technology or creative programming
- **Anyone** who wants to make beats while they code

### Quick Start

```javascript
// Your first beat - just 3 lines
s("bd sd [~ bd] sd")
  .bank("RolandTR808")
  .room(0.2)
```

Press `Ctrl+Enter` and you're making music.
